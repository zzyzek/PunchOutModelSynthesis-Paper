abstract = {Maxim Gumin's WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) algorithm is an example-driven image generation algorithm emerging from the craft practice of procedural content generation. In WFC, new images are generated in the style of given examples by ensuring every local window of the output occurs somewhere in the input. Operationally, WFC implements a non-backtracking, greedy search method. This paper examines WFC as an instance of constraint solving methods. We trace WFC's explosive influence on the technical artist community, explain its operation in terms of ideas from the constraint solving literature, and probe its strengths by means of a surrogate implementation using answer set programming.},

abstract = {There are few proposals to improve the interactivity and control of wave function collapse (WFC) in a mixed-initiative setting. Moreover, most WFC algorithm variants operate on an simple, unstructured set of tiles. This limitation on the level of control provided to designers hampers their creative work in various ways. We propose Hierarchical Semantic WFC, a generalized approach to WFC that organizes its tile-set into a hierarchy akin to a taxonomy induced by the relation ‘consists-of’. In such a hierarchical structure, abstract tiles (i.e. non-leaf nodes) can represent the first sketchy intentions of a designer (e.g. forest, urban, desert,...) This allows a designer to interactively collapse a given area into abstract tiles, while subsequently, (and repeatedly, if desired) WFC can resolve each area into a variety of particular instances, by further collapsing it into (a valid combination of) its children tiles (whether leaves or not). We identify how this subtle tile-set change affects the whole WFC algorithm, describe a number of novel exploratory and interactive functions that this enables, and showcase these with a variety of examples generated with our prototype implementation. We conclude that these new mixed-initiative content generation methods can considerably reduce design iteration times and improve the assistance given to designers in expressing their creative intent.},

We describe the benefits of its asymmetry for level analysis and demonstrate how (not surprisingly) the quality of the results depends on the features used. Here we use tile-patterns of various sizes as features.When using the measure for evolution-based level generation, we demonstrate that the choice of variation operator is critical in order to provide an efficient search process, and introduce a novel convolutional mutation operator to facilitate this. We compare the results with alternative generators, including evolving in the latent space of generative adversarial networks, and Wave Function Collapse. The results clearly show the proposed method to provide competitive performance, providing reasonable quality results with very fast training and reasonably fast generation.},

abstract = {Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a powerful generative algorithm, able to create locally-similar output based on a single example input. One of the inherent limitations of the original WFC is that it often requires users to understand its inner workings, and possibly make their own ad-hoc mods, to achieve satisfactory results. Besides distracting from your creative task, this strongly reduces the algorithm’s effective usefulness to a small group of technical users. We propose miWFC, a novel mixed-initiative approach to WFC aimed at overcoming these drawbacks. Its main focus is on providing intuitive control to its users, in a way that matches their usual creative workflow. Among its main features, this approach provides (i) interactive navigation through design history, including controlled backtracking, (ii) precise manual editing of the output for direct expression of design intent, and (iii) interactive manipulation of tile weights, to tweak the global appearance of the output. We evaluated a prototype implementation of our approach among game artists and other creative professionals, and concluded that its features were largely considered useful and supportive of their creative work.},

We present here new algorithms for arc and path consistency and show that the arc consistency algorithm is optimal in time complexity and of the same-order space complexity as the earlier algorithms. A refined solution for the path consistency problem is proposed. However, the space complexity of the path consistency algorithm makes it practicable only for small problems. These algorithms are the result of the synthesis techniques used in alice (a general constraint satisfaction system) and local consistency methods [3].}

abstract = {Model synthesis is a new approach to 3D modeling which automatically generates large models that resemble a small example model provided by the user. Model synthesis extends the 2D texture synthesis problem into higher dimensions and can be used to model many different objects and environments. The user only needs to provide an appropriate example model and does not need to provide any other instructions about how to generate the model. Model synthesis can be used to create symmetric models, models that change over time, and models that fit soft constraints. There are two important differences between our method and existing texture synthesis algorithms. The first is the use of a global search to find potential conflicts before adding new material to the model. The second difference is that we divide the problem of generating a large model into smaller subproblems which are easier to solve.},

% notes:
% manual tile set creation (from video) (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2421636.2421639)
% metropolis fails miserably
% kl-divergence looks good (I guess)
% mc-sat, slice sampling and blockedsamplesat (neal 00, aux variables), (wei 04, slice)
% use factor graph representation so I would assume this is more in line with a "block level algorithm".
% product slice sampling (mira & tierney 97)

abstract = {Patterns with pleasing structure are common in art, video games, and virtual worlds. We describe a method for synthesizing new patterns of tiles on a regular grid that are similar in appearance to a set of example patterns. Exemplars are used both to specify valid tile arrangements and to emphasize multi-tile structures. We model a pattern as a probabilistic graphical model called a factor graph. Factors represent the hard logical constraints between tiles, the soft statistical relationships that determine style, and the local dependencies between tiles at neighboring sites. We describe a simple method for learning factor functions from a small exemplar. We then synthesize new patterns through a stochastic search method that is inspired by MC-SAT. Efficient synthesis is challenging because of the combination of hard and soft constraints. Our synthesis algorithm, called BlockSS, scales linearly with the number of tiles and the hardness of the problem. We use our technique to model building facades, cities, and decorative patterns.},
